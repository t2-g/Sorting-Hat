# Hogwarts_Sorting_Hat
My First App -
Hello everyone,
This is a Flutter application to find one's Hogwarts Houses - Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. It allows the user to select answers based on which it sorts them.The purpose behind building this application was covering a lot of concepts such as:

1. Showing Widgets on the screen.
2. Recycling Widgets.
3. Changing Screens.
4. Internal Logic.

## Features or Modules:

1. Three multiple-choice questions ( more questions can be added ).
2. Four selectable options for each question in the form of buttons except the last one.
3. The score will be calculated based on the option selected for each question (Internally).
4. And based on the final score a remark will be shown at the end of the quiz in addition to the score and restart button.
5. There are two screens in the app home (where questions will be shown) and the result screen ( where score and remark will be shown).
6. The whole app will be separated into five different modules namely main.dart, question.dart, answer.dart,quiz.dart and result.dart.
